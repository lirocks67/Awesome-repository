      <img src="images/Buie.jpeg">
      <p class="b-ball">Boo Buie is Northwestern's starting point gaurd. He is critical
        to the success of the team and is often the firepower behind
        Northwestern's offense. As a senior, this is his last year to try
        to take the team to the NCAA Tournament.

    </div> 
    <div id="ChaseAudige">
      <h3>Chase Audige</h3>
      <img src="images/Audige.jpeg">
      <p class="b-ball">Chase Audige is Northwestern's starting shooting guard. He's another
        vital aspect of the team. He and Buie combine for most of the teams offense.
        On the defensive end, he is one of the strongest defenders in the Big 10.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="RobbieBeran">
      <h3>Robbie Beran</h3>
      <img src="images/Beran.jpeg">
      <p class="b-ball">Robbie Beran is another key member of the team. He's averaging nearly 10 points per games
        and he helps create shot opportunities for his team mates.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="MattNicholson">
      <h3>Matt Nicholson</h3>
      <img src="images/Matt.jpeg">
      <p class="b-ball">Matt Nicholson is Northwestern's starting center. His role is crucial as he brings in the size for 
        the squad. Nicholson's biggest strength comes in his rebounding ability.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="TyBerry">
      <h3>Ty Berry</h3>
      <img src="images/Berry.jpeg">
      <p class="b-ball">Ty Berry's contributions come from behind the three-point line. He often enters the game to 
        give his teammates the spark they need to get momentum. He's quick, effecient, and a valuable 
        member of the Wildcats.
